In the middle of July 2017, we introduced the 7th edition for [BlogrCart Blogger themes](http://blog.irsah.com/gallery) with e-commerce functionality. Create online web stores get much more easier on a perfectly free platform like Blogger (aka blogspot).  
  
We received many requests by our users to convert this ecommerce Blogger template to use AMP HTML which includes the usage of search product data tags introduced by search engines like Google.  
  
Initially, BlogrCart SEVEN theme is using responsive design approach -- Bootsrap3 framework, which makes your blog store display unique on the web & mobile devices -- while looking professional too!
