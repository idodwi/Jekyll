This coming 25th May 2018, EU will enforce the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR -- also known as EU-DSGVO), where all web site owner(s)/operator(s) who collects data via their web pages (in this case Blogger blog pages) must comply to this new regulation.  
  
In this article we are not discussing on what is GDPR or DSGVO. You can get more information by visiting (& reading) [euggdpr.org](http://www.eugdpr.org/the-regulation.html) website & [GDPR Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).  
  
In a nutshell, the GDPR is designed to unify data protection rules across Europe and set out compliance obligations for the movement of data within the EU and between EU member states and their global partners. Essentially, it aims to improve the handling and storage of personal data and keep it safe from misuse.
