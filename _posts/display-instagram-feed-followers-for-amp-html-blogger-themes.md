Add Instagram posts, feed, followers & following count is made super easy for [AMP HTML integrated Blogger blogs](https://ampaction.blogspot.com/) by using `amp-iframe` component with `ampaction-js` an AMP HTML helper for blogs on Blogger  
  
In a nutshell, AMP HTML already provides `amp-instagram` component to fetch a single post from any Instagram account by using the unique media ID supplied by Instagram.  
  
Even though adding multiple or [long list of AMP Instagram embeds](https://ampbyexample.com/advanced/long_list_of_amp-instagram_embeds/) for AMP pages is pretty much responsive & fast, we thought it would be much easier for Blogger users to maintain & grab their own Instagram feed dynamically -- as it is viewed at Instagram.

Due to the above constraints on Blogger platform, we've developed a unique plugin to display Instagram feed dynamically using [ampaction-js](https://blogr-amp.github.io/) & [Instafeedjs](http://instafeedjs.com/) which Blogger blog users can easily use & integrate at their AMP HTML powered Blogger themes & templates.
